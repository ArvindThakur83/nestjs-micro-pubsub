# NestJS Microservice: Redis Pub/Sub + MongoDB

## ðŸš€ Description

A simple microservices-based architecture using **NestJS**, **Redis Pub/Sub**, and **MongoDB**, all containerized with Docker.

This project consists of two services:
- **receiver-service**: Receives user data via an API, stores it in MongoDB, and publishes it to a Redis channel.
- **listener-service**: Subscribes to the Redis channel and saves the published data (with modifications) into a separate MongoDB collection.
